          It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. What is dead may never
          die. The wolf and the lion. You know nothing, Jon Snow. You know nothing, Jon Snow. Can a man still be brave
          if he’s afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave.Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these
          days. Lucky for the ladies. May the Father judge him justly. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these
          days. Lucky for the ladies. The winds of Winter. All men must die. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. Never Resting.
          Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. The North remembers. The winds of Winter. The tourney of Ashford
          Meadows. May the Father judge him justly. Never Resting.The tourney of Ashford Meadows. The Dothraki do things
          in their own time, for their own reasons. The wolf and the lion. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a
          bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. The Knight of Lemonwood. King in the North. A dream of
          Spring. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. Fire and blood. Our Sun Shines Bright. A dream of Spring. It is rare to
          meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.
